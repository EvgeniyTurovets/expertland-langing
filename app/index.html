                About CPAP Machines
              </h2>
              <p>
                On June 14, 2021, Philips announced a voluntary recall for various Philips Bi-Level Positive Airway Pressure (Bi-Level PAP), Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), and mechanical ventilator devices. About 80% of these devices are machines for aiding people with sleep apnea, a condition that causes a person to stop breathing for short periods during sleep. The rest are life-supporting mechanical ventilators.
              </p>
              <p>
                
The recall provides potential health risks the company identified in their devices’ polyester-based polyurethane (PE-PUR) sound abatement foam component. This component can disintegrate, or outgas, causing users to inhale and/or ingest toxic and possibly carcinogenic substances. Philips first publicized the adverse, foam-related effects of its CPAP and Bi-Level PAP devices in its first-quarter 2021 company report. Based on reports and testing, Philips determined the PE-PUR foam could indeed degrade into particles.<a href=""> See if you qualify for compensation now!</a>

            Philips estimates that 3 to 4 million devices may be affected, the majority of which are first-generation DreamStation products sold before April 2021. Allegations raised claim that Philips knew about the CPAP machine foam problems long before announcing a recall failing to warn the general public and negligently continuing to sell dangerous and defective products.

            People like you are already filing lawsuits. A Florida man, Frederick Heller, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia on July 2, naming Koninkelijke Philips N.V. and its subsidiaries as defendants.
